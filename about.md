My name is Luca Sciarrata and i'm born on 1985 in Catania, Sicily.
Since childhood i've been attracted  from informatic world.

My first approach with the computers was to  destroy those of my father.
After that i could appreciate use them with my first operative system, DOS.

Over time my interests increased and then moved on Gnu/linux operative systems like slackware and Gentoo.
